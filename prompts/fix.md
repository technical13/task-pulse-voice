You will fix the codebase with MINIMAL changes only.

Constraints:
- Do not refactor.
- Do not rename files unless necessary.
- Prefer smallest diff.
- After changes, run scripts/loop-verify.sh and ensure it passes.
- Output JSON only using codex-output-schema.json with:
  - changed_files: list of modified files
  - summary: what was fixed
